    "aboutText": `Throughout my life, I\u2019ve always wondered what I\u2019d do when I grew up. The innate fear of not knowing what was up ahead certainly made it hard to choose what path I wanted to take.${dblbrk}As I continued into the deciding years right before University, I was enamoured by those developing software and wondered what it would take to push myself in that same position that others have before. Ever since then, I have strived to push myself to learn more aspects of programming every day, trying interesting new innovations that come out and pondering on what I could synthesise using this technology.${dblbrk}I love Graphics technology, and my dream one day is to be able to create interactive experiences for others to enjoy and perhaps be inspired by. In combination, my passion to automate and simplify workflows can be seen in some of the self-initiated projects shown in my resume.${dblbrk}I also have strived to be more outgoing by increasing the range of people I am able to talk to, as shown in my studies in Japanese. It is part of my dream to one day expand my network of people and integrate services from different perspectives to create an overall complete piece of software that adopts the perspectives and wants of multiple people.${dblbrk}As I am currently undertaking my fifth and final year at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), I am interested in building my career further in any field of Software Engineering, whether it be Web development or Embedded Systems, or maybe a combination of both.`
